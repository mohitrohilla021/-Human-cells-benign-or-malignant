A tumor is an abnormal lump or growth of cells. When the cells in the tumor are normal, it is benign. Something just went wrong, and they overgrew and produced a lump. When the cells are abnormal and can grow uncontrollably, they are cancerous cells, and the tumor is malignant.

When you hear the word tumor, you likely think of cancer. But, in fact, many tumors aren’t cancerous.
A tumor is a cluster of abnormal cells. Depending on the types of cells in a tumor, it can be:
Benign. The tumor doesn’t contain cancerous cells.
Premalignant or precancerous. It contains abnormal cells that have the potential to become cancerous.
Malignant. The tumor contains cancerous cells.

SVM works by mapping data to a high-dimensional feature space so that data points can be categorized, even when the data are not otherwise linearly separable.

A separator between the categories is found, then the data is transformed in such a way that the separator could be drawn as a hyperplane. 

Following this, characteristics of new data can be used to predict the group to which a new record should belong.
